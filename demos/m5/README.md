# Milestone 5 demo

This directory contains the resources needed for running the release demo for Milestone 5.

## Environments

This demo can run in two different environments:

* **dev**: Use this environment to run on an empty CRC cluster with Openshift Pipelines preinstalled.
* **staging**: This environment is meant to be used in a cluster bootstrapped with infra-deployments.
